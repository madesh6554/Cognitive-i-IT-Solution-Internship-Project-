## Project:
During this internship project, I developed two distinct datasets for analysis: 
    1. Entertainment Industry Analysis 
    2. India Rainfall Analysis 
### **1. Entertainment Industry Analysis:**
The **Entertainment Industry Analysis** focuses on identifying trends in budget 
allocation, movie releases, and the correlation between ratings, providing insights to 
support strategic decision-making for a movie review company. This analysis helps 
uncover patterns that influence financial performance and audience reception in the 
entertainment sector.

### **2. India Rainfall Analysis:**
The **India Rainfall Analysis** investigates long-term trends, seasonal variations, and 
state-wise distribution of rainfall. It also examines the impacts of climate change and 
detects extreme weather events, offering valuable insights into regional weather 
patterns and helping inform decisions related to agriculture, disaster preparedness, and 
climate adaptation.

Both analyses aim to provide actionable insights by utilizing data-driven approaches, 
supporting decision-makers with evidence-based findings.
